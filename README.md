# THE-GAME
i plan to sent this game to my friend at her birthday as a gift.

The game is about a boy/girl (i don't define the sex of my characterï¼‰loop in the same day.(tomorrow is still today)
The game likes a kind of normal AVG,but!!!i hate the options in those games.
The choice or options limit players behavior.
So i decide to make a open type avg(can not online because my capacity)
The player can type the words to push the story,and get the clues about the other branches which can be used in the loop day.
However,there is less 20days for me to finish the project,i guess the game can be clear in five times loop.(if the player is so smart that each choose is correct)
If i think the game is not so bad,i will continue to perfect it.
